# Introduction

As publishers have embraced header bidding, running multiple header tags from different providers has become a top priority with many considerations.

The main areas of concern are:

*   Code conflict
*   Inability to control timeouts efficiently
*   Development time required per integration
*   Lack of holistic insights and analytics
*   Changing the page and tag structure to accommodate for header tag.

We came up with a simple way to use wrapper tags which solves for all the issues above and most importantly, was specifically designed to be plug-and-play with the GPT tags. 

What this means for publishers:

*   No changes to GPT structure
*   No coding required to get and push bids to GPT (not even setting targeting)
*   Works with standard as well as advanced GPT implementations.

All the publisher has to do is push the wrapper script and partner configuration live on the page and you are done. It’s that simple. The script takes care of detecting what ad units, divs and sizes are on page, fire up calls to desired partners and attach bids to DFP calls as key-values.

# Design and Execution Flow

# <span style="font-size: 20.0px;line-height: 1.5;">Interaction with GPT tag</span>

*   Wrapper script interacts with GPT tags by overriding basic GPT functions like display(), refresh() ... 
*   The original display calls to DFP are put in queue until all the Wrapper partners are called for bid or desired timeout is reached.
*   Final auction between the bids takes place and the highest bid is pushed as key-value to DFP
*   Here is the flow diagram for someone who wants to have a look at the code and understands what is happening inside the hood.

# Getting Started

## Check Out

The source files include adapters for all of the current header tag integrations. The developer only has to include the required adapters while building and generating a tag using the instructions below.

## Build

The checked out source contains adapters for following header tags:

1.  AdForm
2.  AppNexus
3.  bRealTime
4.  DistrictM
5.  IndexExchange
6.  OpenX
7.  PubMatic
8.  Rubicon Project
9.  Yieldbot

We have a python build script which helps you build the wrapper tag with only the adapters you need and gives you a minimize tag which you can directly use.

From the repository you have checked out, run combine.py. Once this file is executed, you will get owt.combine.js and owt.combine.min.js generated in a directory named 'dist.' 
Combine.py contains adapterFiles array, which holds all the adapters to be included in generated open wrapper js file. You may want to add or remove partner adapters to keep only your required partners in your tag.

## Deploy

The generated script should be deployed on a test page before trying it on production.
You can load the generated minimized js either synchronously or asynchronously on your pages.
To load minimized js synchronously, you can use below tag in the header section of your test page-

    <script type="text/javascript" src="/js/owt.combine.min.js"></script>


And to load minimized wrapper js script asynchronously before GPT using callback, you can use below tag-

    <!--GPT Tag with Callback begins here -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var PWT = {}; //Initialize Namespace
        var googletag = googletag || {};
        googletag.cmd = googletag.cmd || [];
        PWT.jsLoaded = function() { // Wrapper tag on load callback is used to load GPT
            (function() {
                var gads = document.createElement('script');
                var useSSL = 'https:' == document.location.protocol;
                gads.src = (useSSL ? 'https:' : 'http:') + '//www.googletagservices.com/tag/js/gpt.js';
                var node = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
                node.parentNode.insertBefore(gads, node);
            })();
        }
    </script>
    <!--GPT Tag ends here -->
    <!--Wrapper Tag starts here -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
        (function() {
            var wtads = document.createElement('script');
            wtads.async = true;
            wtads.type = 'text/javascript';
            wtads.src = 'owt.js';
            var node = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
            node.parentNode.insertBefore(wtads, node);
        })();
    </script>
    <!--Wrapper Tag ends here -->


## Test

You can either test the generated open wrapper tag in your local dev/test environment or if you just want to see how it works, you can refer to the below links to demo pages section that are checked in.

## Auction and Timeout

  ![Auction Logic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PubMatic/OpenWrap/master/images/AuctionLogic.png)


# DFP Setup and Line Item creation

# Ad Server Configuration

## Trafficking Wrapper Line Items

This step is required so the ad server, based on actual bid price, can allocate impressions to the winning partner. These bids are passed using key-value pairs added to the ad server tags dynamically, as explained in the previous sections.


**Step 1:** Create a new order in DFP for a Wrapper as OpenWrap as the advertiser and add the relevant details.


![New Order](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PubMatic/OpenWrap/master/images/New%20Order.jpg)
  
  
**Step 2:** Set the price and priority of the line items.  

![Step 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PubMatic/OpenWrap/master/images/LineItem.jpg)
  

**Step 3: **Set targeting on the “pwtbst” value as 1 from the. In addition to  “pwtbst”,  you will also need to set targeting on “pwtecp”.  For more information, please refer to the [Best Practices to Create Line Items]

![Step 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PubMatic/OpenWrap/master/images/Targeting.jpg)


**Step 4: **Add the Wrapper creative provided by PubMatic to the line item you created. 

    <script type='text/javascript'>
    var i = 0, w = window.self;
    while(w!== window.top && !(w.PWT && w.PWT.displayCreative) && i<10){
     w = window.self.parent; i++;
    }
    try{ w.PWT.displayCreative(document, '%%PATTERN:pwtsid%%'); } catch(e){}
    </script></script></pre>


## Best Practices for Creating Granular Line Items

**Note: If DFP is the ad server,</span>** **<span>ensure the line items do NOT have the Google safe frame setting enabled.</span>** >
After June 27th, 2016, line items are automatically created in DFP with safe frame enabled by default. This setting will cause the creative to appear as blank. This requires that users manually uncheck "safe frame," regardless of whether it was manually or automatically enabled.

To control monetization through OpenWrap at a granular level, you may:

*   Create multiple line items in the ad server for each ad unit/ad size/CPM range/geo.
*   Use “**pwtecp**” as the targeting attribute.
*   Place the line items at different priorities based on the desired configuration.

While creating line items at multiple price points, we recommend you create line items with more granular pricing where the bid density is high.

**For example:**

If 80% of the bids are between $0 to $3, create line items at a $0.1 granularity. For other ranges you can create line items at a coarse granularity.

Please see more details below. 

**30 line items between $0-$3 with rate increment of $0.1    **

LineItem 1 (covers $0-$0.09)  Targeting: pwtecp=0.01*,pwtecp=0.02*....,pwtecp=0.09*, rate=$0.05

LineItem 2 (covers $0.10-$0.19) Targeting: pwtecp=0.1*, rate=$0.15

and so on for next 28 line items

**15 Line items between $3-$8 with rate increment of $0.30    **

LineItem 31 (covers $3.0-$3.29)  Targeting: pwtecp=3.0*,pwtecp=3.1*,pwtecp=3.2*, rate=$3.15

LineItem 32 (covers $3.30-$3.59)  Targeting: pwtecp=3.3*,pwtecp=3.4*,pwtecp=3.5*, rate=$3.45

and so on for next 13 line items   

**12 Line items between $9-$20 with rate increment of $1.0    **

LineItem 46 (covers $9.0-$9.99)  Targeting: pwtecp=9.*, rate=$9.5

LineItem 47 (covers $10.0-$10.99)  Targeting: pwtecp=10.*, rate=$3.45

and so on for next 10 line items   

**A final high- priority line item for very high bids**

Line Item 58 (Covers $20 and above) Targeting : pwtecp=20*,pwtecp=21*,pwtecp=22*...... pwtecp=50*) rate= $21
